  "about": [
    "Good dawning to thee, friend. I'm an artist and creative technologist (and secretly an aspiring mathematician) whose work is grounded in philosophy, new media research and information experience design. I like to learn new things -- particularly, I'm fascinated with the theory of knowledge, interpretability of statistical models, and social complexity. This site is a scrapbook of sorts, where I attempt to capture fragments of my (somewhat restless) mind in flux.",
    "I've developed and exhibited a range of collaborative works across spaces, places and frequencies: Barbican Open Lab, HOME Manchester, IKLECTIK, RA Lates, Resonance FM/Extra, Royal College of Art, Somerset House, SPILL Festival of Performance, University of the Arts London, WIRED Japan Creative Hack Awards, fringe venues, and online. I mainly practice creative coding; but dabble in theatre, sound and radio, and occasionally perform. Below are some samples of my work, and in my blog expect to find a range of short fiction, memes, <i>super cereal</i> junk as well as other existential musings. Please use the contact page, should you wish to leave a message. Here be internet dragons.",

Why shouldn't people just go where they feel like and order what they want? Why do they need someone to tell them? What's a menu for? And then, after I write the place up, the place gets famous and the cooking and service go to hell. It always happens. Supply and demand get all screwed up. And it was me who screwed it up. I do it one by one, nice and neat. I find what's pure and clean and see that it gets all mucked up. But that's what people call information.</i> - Unnamed protagonist (Murakami, 1988)"

        "BAM. Something woke me up in the early hours of the morning. I was confused. There was no better word to describe my mental state at the time. My chest felt tight; brain fatigued and overworked. I could see no light through the sheers; but frankly, in any case was I in no form to produce coherent thoughts about time, having been summoned prematurely from the depths of my unconscious mind.",
        "I sat up on the edge of my futon bed. The floor beneath my feet felt solid, and from what first seemed like an innocent pinch of chill on my toes emerged an overwhelming wave of cold, that traversed vertically through my body -- ruthlessly straightening my spine.",
        "The first notable thing to occupy my mind was the downpour of rain, gently brushing the ceiling above me. The sound was arrhythmic, but soft and pleasant and something that I was lost to, simply listening, for a good while. The comfort was short-lived: in reality, I was losing out on a significant chunk of shuteye (as in the night before, and the night before that, as well as the countless nights recently passed). I knew deep down that it was risky business to leverage my energy reserves; I was knees-deep in water, fully aware of the rising surface, wanting to cut my losses, but lost in the tide.",
        "By now, my legs were borderline numb, and my body fully awake. The coldness was no longer an imposition. There was little point in further resisting the unpleasantness of the bare stone tiles and, in a rather militant manner, my body actualised. Soon thereafter, as my mind caught up, I found myself approaching the kitchen.",
        "My mornings had a ritualistic aspect to them, though I wasn't sure if they actually qualified as rituals per se. Sure, there was a repetitive framework within which everything occurred: coffee, radio and some reads. However, the events lacked consistency (in how they were ordered); and I could effortlessly lose myself to any of these activities for extensive periods of time. But everything happened semi-consciously: my mind was relatively free to venture elsewhere, as my body performed familiar sets of actions, day-in-day-out. Distinctly, the mornings were blessed by clarity, whereas noon was unreasonably costly for my attention span.",
        "I listened to the ambient symphony, now augmented by a flood of coffee dripping into the glass pan. My nose caught onto the familiar scent, that filled the room. I drifted off but was soon grounded by the bleak realisation that it was yet another Monday. Meaning that another week had passed; another had begun, and soon it too would be lost to entropy, gradually disintegrating from once-a-clear-memory to messy insignificant fragments floating in time. And to top it all off, I would probably be standing in the same spot, yet again contemplating the cycle.",
        "I observed nothing of interest out in the garden. The absence of life was normal at this time of year, I guessed, but the stillness was eerie, nevertheless. It could also be night-time -- I was still unsure. Time-of-day mattered little, as I would be unable to return to sleep regardless. Due to my insomnia, time had become more elastic and expendable.",
        "I noticed a full moon in the sky, existing in captivating stillness with few stars distributed across the murky cloudscape. Unperturbed, I poured myself coffee. I walked over to the other room and put on a record; I sat down, and drank the coffee…"

        "'You're taking away the poetry from my world, man,' I thought, as I listened intently to the passionate gentleman standing before me.",
        "I drew to pass the time (and to distract myself from thinking about you): an abstract city of information; populated by two androgynous figures overlooking the monotonous plane. 'Look around,' they say. 'The patterns are vague here.' And true they were. The horizon was clouded by a vast sea of noise.",
        "All beings and things around me faded, and I sunk deep into my chair held gently against the hard plastic not only by the ever-penetrating force of gravity but also an ineffable energy: I lost myself to thought, losing track of the day, of position, and of all earthly concepts; a fluffy cloud of nothingness surrounded me as I lost all phenomenal presence. I was stripped down and smitten by my memories. WHACK.",
        "The scene played out within the confines of my mind. I was transported some nights back: holding your gaze, somewhat shy, evoking an atmosphere of tension tender but wild. THUMP. Forces collided in time and space; a profoundly unexpected moment and unanticipated feeling, like an ephemeral poem recited by the universe, emerging momentarily amidst the chaos for us to share. 'Yada yada…' my lips were moving to a well-rehearsed story, but my attention was fixed in your stare.",
        "The sonata goes on. The jazz keeps on playing. The moon, perpetually fixed at its piercing exposure, smiling. Does a vision materialise when dreamed?"

        "'Adorno was onto something,' I realised, as my shadow wandered through the peculiar scene resembling a familiar tale; perhaps, from the stories of <i>One Thousand and One Nights</i>: a vast desertscape exposed by starlight. Whilst my body lay static on the dune, I was left to navigate the restless labyrinth of my mind.",
        "The view was utterly hypnotising, and I began to draw imaginary connections between each glaring ball of gas in the sky, the light emitting a narrative for the rest of the universe to read: complex histories interwoven; the past and the present compressed into a 2D tapestry, broadcast as a nebulous glow, a heap of meaningless noise.",
        "'I have no knowledge of astronomy,' I murmured to myself, but noticed in the periphery of my eye an uncanny constellation emerging.",
        "I awoke to a sensation of sand dripping down my face; and discovered myself half asleep before a computer screen. A glance outside, through the lonely studio window, was telling of night-time: few apartments displayed any evidence of life in the block facing mine. I prepared myself some coffee, and thereafter devoted my full attention to the task at hand: swiftly, I was swallowed into bit space, and my consciousness descended into a dense philosophical fog.",
        "'Epoch 10,000,' proclaimed the terminal, and so, my algorithmic score had been iterated over and played to its end; and yet another ideology had taken material form. Superficially speaking, the results were impressive, but I was unable to articulate the magic bubbling beneath the surface. I imagined life inside my crystal ball, a somewhat absurd personification of computation: a fantasia of microscopic cogwheels and alien lifeforms tearing down my input images into individual pixels, rearranging these into strings and mechanically transforming the sequences into increasingly intelligible sets of features, the laborious process of prediction overseen by an executive jury. The vision humoured me.",
        "Indeed, the operational aspects of my network were concealed, obfuscated by intricate mathematical operations; therefore, making its internal workings unexplainable. Although I wanted to avoid speculating on its wider implications, the idea of deploying abstract authority into a real-world context felt rather worrying. The performance was otherwordly but indecipherable without a map of some kind: to represent the hierarchy, to read my stars.",
        "I felt the full weight of my insomnia, accentuated by caffeine. It was hard to believe that a fragment of my reality could be captured by the system and, literally, broken into bits. The first observable patterns from my experiments evoked a paralysing sense of awe, a childlike wonder, that I continued to experience long into the gentle winter dawn."
