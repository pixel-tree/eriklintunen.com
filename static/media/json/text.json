  "bio": [
    "An artist and researcher (and secretly an aspiring mathematician) whose work is grounded in critical theory, new media and philosophy. I like to learn new things and design experiences to communicate complex ideas.",
    "I’ve developed and exhibited a range of collaborative works across spaces, places and frequencies: Barbican Centre, Central Saint Martins, Chelsea College of Arts, HOME Manchester, IKLECTIK, London College of Communication, RA Lates, Resonance FM/Extra, Royal College of Art, Somerset House, SPILL Festival of Performance, fringe events internationally, as well as online. I practice creative coding, dabble in theatre, sound and radio, and occasionally perform.",
    "In 2004, I was the recipient of the Clitheroe 2000 Young Achiever Award. In 2018, I was awarded residencies as part of Barbican HOME Open Lab; my work was commissioned for Resonance’s Strands supported by Jerwood Charitable Foundation; and I was selected as a finalist for the WIRED Japan Creative Hack Award."
